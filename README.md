## Description

Simple gallery website to publish images and videos. I want to keep this rather simple. At least nothing server side. Perhaps JavaScript can have more functionality. It should be very easy from having images to have some sort of image gallery on web.

## Requirements

Web server + autoindexing. Should work with at least Nginx and Apache.

## Usage

* (Optional) Run auto-orient-medias.sh in same directory with media files to auto-orient them.
* Copy all images, videos and gallery.\* files to same directory to web server with autoindex on.
