## Description

Simple gallery website to publish images (and videos perhaps). I want to keep this rather simple. At least nothing server side. Perhaps JavaScript can have more functionality. It should be very easy from having images to have some sort of image gallery on web.

## Requirements

ImageMagick for auto orienting images.

## Usage

* Run rename-images.sh on directory where you have the images you want to publish.
* Copy all images and gallery.\* files to a server.
